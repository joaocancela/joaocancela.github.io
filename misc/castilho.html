    <h1>Instructions for Castilho 209</h1>
    
    <h2>Welcome to our home! Here we provide you some advice in order to make the most of it. Feel free to get in touch whenever you want. Enjoy your stay!</h2>

    <p><strong>Blankets, Sheets, and Towels:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feel free to use any available items.</li>
        <li>Find sheets and towels in the colorful low cabinet in the room.</li>
        <li>Extra blankets are stored on the upper doors of the room’s closet.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Windows:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The windows have three positions: closed, wide open, or pivoted.</li>
        <li>Avoid pivoting the middle window in the living room; it can be challenging to close.</li>
        <li>In the bathroom, the window handle is different and may be slightly stuck, but it should work.</li>
        <li>If windows are left wide open for an extended period, mosquitoes may enter. Use the electronic repellent device in the kitchen pantry; read the instructions first.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Heater:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can control the temperature and set the timer with the buttons on the side.</li>
        <li>Two heaters are available; feel free to rearrange them as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Pantry:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feel free to use cleaning products, hardware, extra bags, and the two additional chairs.</li>
        <li>A clothes hanger is provided for both indoor and outdoor use. If necessary, a self-service laundry with a dryer is located at Rua Rodrigo da Fonseca 133.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Kitchen:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Utilize any available items in the kitchen.</li>
        <li>A brand-new bread machine is on top; remember to wash it with water before use.</li>
        <li>Clean the oven top using only water or a designated cleaning product to prevent damage.</li>
        <li>Sort garbage into three categories: blue (cleaned paper), yellow (plastic and metal), and grey (undifferentiated). Dispose of glass in the large green trash bin on either Rua Castilho or Rua Padre António Vieira.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Bathroom:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the fabric baskets just outside the bathroom for dirty laundry.</li>
        <li>Find stationery in the box on the left door.</li>
        <li>The towel heater works by turning the wheel or setting it to turn on at the same time every day; adjust the other wheel to 24h on the desired time during the first day, and it will memorize that hour.</li>
        <li>We use blue towels for the bathroom floor, which are kept on the top shelf.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Living room:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can easily adjust the table size as needed.</li>
        <li>Wash and reinsert chair feet protections for improved sound and floor protection.</li>
        <li>The corner protections on the chairs are there for the safety of our children. Feel free to remove them if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Protect the sofa with the two washable cobertas for added comfort and cleanliness. Feel free to remove them as well.</li>
    </ul>
