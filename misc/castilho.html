    <h1>Instructions for Castilho 209</h1>
    
    <h2>Welcome!</h2>

    <p><strong>Blankets and sheets and towels:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are welcome to use whatever you find.</li>
        <li>Sheets and towels are on the colorful low cabinet in the room.</li>
        <li>Extra blankets are on the upper doors of the room’s closet.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Windows:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The windows have 3 positions: closed, wide open, or pivoted.</li>
        <li>Please don’t pivot the middle window of the living room; it is difficult to close again.</li>
        <li>In the bathroom, the window handle is different; it might be a bit stuck, but it should work.</li>
        <li>When you leave the windows wide open for a long time, mosquitoes may get in. Use the electronic repellent device in the kitchen pantry, and read the instructions first.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Heater:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can control the temperature and time of the heater with the buttons on the side.</li>
        <li>You have two heaters; feel free to move them around as you wish.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Pantry:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feel free to use cleaning products, hardware, extra bags, and 2 extra chairs.</li>
        <li>There's a clothes hanger for outdoor or indoor use. Laundry facilities are available at Rua Rodrigo da Fonseca 133 if needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Kitchen:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use anything you find.</li>
        <li>There is a brand-new bread machine on top; wash with water before using it.</li>
        <li>Clean the oven top with water or a special cleaning product to avoid damage.</li>
        <li>Sort garbage into the blue (paper), yellow (plastic and metal), and grey (undifferentiated) trash cans. Dispose of glass in the green trash bin on Rua Castilho or Rua Padre António Vieira.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Bathroom:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the fabric baskets outside the bathroom for dirty laundry.</li>
        <li>Find stationery in the box on the left door.</li>
        <li>The towel heater works by turning the wheel or setting it to turn on daily at a specific time.</li>
        <li>We use blue towels for the bathroom floor and keep them on the top shelf.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Living room:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adjust the table size easily.</li>
        <li>Wash and reinsert chair feet protections for sound improvement and floor protection.</li>
        <li>Corner protections on chairs are for children. Feel free to remove them.</li>
        <li>Protect the sofa with washable cobertas for comfort and cleanliness. Feel free to remove them.</li>
    </ul>
