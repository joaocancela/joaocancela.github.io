	<p> My main research interests are related to comparative political behaviour, but I have worked and published on other topics such as political institutions, civil society, and elites' attitudes. I tend to take a pragmatic, problem-solving approach to the study of politics, and therefore use different methods to address different questions. I have conducted research using quantitative techniques (spatial regression, cluster analysis, survey experiments or social network analysis) and qualitative methods (archival research and focus groups). </p>
	<p> In the Spring 2024 semester I was the FLAD visiting professor at the <a href= "https://Governmentent.georgetown.edu/">Department of Government of Georgetown University</a>, in Washington DC. Previously I worked as an adjunct instructor at the <a href="https://www.eeg.uminho.pt"> School of Economics and Management of the University of Minho</a> (2017-2019) and as a policy officer at the <a href="https://www.acm.gov.pt/inicio">High Commission for Migration (ACM, I.P.)</a> (2012-2013). I was a Visiting PhD student at the <a href="https://circap.unisi.it/"> Centre for the Study of Political Change (CIRCaP)</a> in Siena, Italy in 2014-2015.</p>
