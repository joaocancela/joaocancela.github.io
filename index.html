	<h1>João Cancela</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my website! I am an aspiring Political Scientist currently completing my PhD at Universidade Nova de Lisboa with a dissertation about the roots of differences in political participation and engagement at the national and local level, focusing on the Portuguese case.    </p>
	<p> My research interests are not circumscribed to political behaviour: I have worked and published on other topics such as political institutions, civil society, elites' attitudes, and immigration. I tend to take a pragmatic, problem-solving approach to the study of politics, which makes me use different methods for answering to different questions. This has led me to conduct research using use both quantitative techniques (spatial regression, cluster analysis and social network analysis) and qualitative methods. </p>
	<p> In addition to conducting research, I have also lectured as a sole instructor a number of different courses since 2016 in Nova University and the School of Economics and Management of University of Minho. </p>  
	<p> In this website you can find a copy of my CV and links to my publications.
