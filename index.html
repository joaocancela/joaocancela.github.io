	<p> Welcome to my website! I am an aspiring Political Scientist currently completing my PhD at Faculdade de Ciências Sociais e Humanas, Universidade Nova de Lisboa. My thesis addresses the roots of differences in political participation and engagement at the national and local level, focusing on the Portuguese case. It should be completed by the end of 2017. This is not a big website, so please feel free to browse around. You can reach me at joaocancela [at] gmail dot com 
		
		You can also find me at Google Scholar, Research Gate, and ORCID.
