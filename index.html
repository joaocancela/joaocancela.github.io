	<h1>João Cancela</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my website! I am an assistant professor of Political Science at <a href= "https://www.fcsh.unl.pt/">NOVA FCSH</a>, in Lisbon, Portugal. In the Spring 2024 semester I will be the FLAD visiting professor at the Department of Government of Georgetown University, in Washington DC.
	<p> My main research interests are related to comparative political behaviour, but I have worked and published on other topics such as political institutions, civil society, elites' attitudes, and migration. I tend to take a pragmatic, problem-solving approach to the study of politics, and therefore use different methods to address different questions. I have conducted research using quantitative techniques (meta-analysis, spatial regression, cluster analysis or social network analysis) and qualitative methods (archival research). </p>
	<p> Previously I worked as an adjunct instructor at the <a href="https://www.eeg.uminho.pt"> School of Economics and Management of the University of Minho</a> (2017-2019) and as a policy officer at the <a href="https://www.acm.gov.pt/inicio">High Commission for Migration (ACM, I.P.)</a> (2012-2013).</p>
