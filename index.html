	<h1>João Cancela</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my website! I am an aspiring Political Scientist currently completing my PhD at Universidade Nova de Lisboa. </p>
	<p> My main research interests are related to comparative political behaviour, but I have worked and published on other topics such as political institutions, civil society, elites' attitudes, and migration. I tend to take a pragmatic, problem-solving approach to the study of politics, and therefore use different methods to address different questions. I have conducted research using quantitative techniques, such as spatial regression, cluster analysis or social network analysis, and qualitative methods. </p>
	<p>  I had the opportunity to start teaching at an early stage in two different universities at the BA/undergraduate level: since 2016 at Nova University and since 2017 at the School of Economics and Management of the University of Minho. </p>  
	<p> In this website you can find a copy of my CV, links to my publications, and some course materials. You can also check my profiles at <a href=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3uFaAyQAAAAJ&hl>Google Scholar</a>, <a href=https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5055-2060>ORCID</a>, <a href=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joao_Cancela > Research Gate</a>, and <a href=https://publons.com/researcher/1185891/joao-cancela/> Publons</a>.</p>
